        <h2 style="margin-left: 20px;">Report</h2>
        <p>Firstly I have used <b>navigation element</b> to navigate to different divs. After that I used three <b>div</b> elements
        The first div was used for my picture and about my-self. Import picture by using image element and content by using paragraph.
        After that the 2nd div was used to express why I like web-development and that I have done by using paragraph element
        and then I listed some websites that I like and want to create some websites like them by my own efforts. This part is done by using 
        unorderd list and I have puts links to that websites. 3rd div was used to express why I don't like the web-development. 
        In this div I have used one header element for Heading and one paragraph element.
        This CSS file applies general styling to the body with a specific font, background color, and text properties. 
        The .container ensures a structured layout with a centered width. The header is styled with a dark blue background, white text, 
        a cyan border at the bottom, and navigation links that are floated to the right while branding aligns to the left. 
        Navigation links have uppercase styling, hover effects, and spacing between items. The portfolio section uses .text-container 
        for left-aligned text and .right-image for circular images floated to the right. Images have rounded corners, and links remove 
        default underlines. The .contact section is inline with an attempt to float it at the start. The layout relies on float, 
        inline-block, and margins for alignment without using flexbox. 
        The file ensures a clean and modern appearance with hover effects, spacing, and structured elements.</p>
